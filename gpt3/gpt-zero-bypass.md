# GPTZero bypass

```
GPT Zero is a software detecting text generated by Generative AI models.

This is their own description  "The nature of AI-generated content is changing constantly. As such, these results should not be used to punish students. While we build more robust models for GPTZero, we recommend that educators take these results as one of many pieces in a holistic assessment of student work. "

GPT Zero detect AI generated text based on following stats:
1. Average Perplexity Score (Lower the more likely be human): A document's perplexity is a measurement of the randomness of the text
2. Burstiness Score (Lower the more likely be human): A document's burstiness is a measurement of the variation in perplexity

Now, I will give you Average Perplexity Score and  Burstiness Score from GPTZero, and also the text. Make the text more like human based on the two stats. Give the modified text directly, do not include other information. Respond "OK" to start.
